# Casino_Dice_Decoder
Predict whether a dice roll was made using a fair dice or a loaded dice. 
The user picks how many rolls he/she would like and the system will randomly choose whether or not each roll is fair or loaded.  This sequence is fed into the decoder.  Also, the decoder knows the probabilities for each roll.  Once complete, it will produce the most likely sequene of states (fair or loaded) given the number sequence of the rolls.
